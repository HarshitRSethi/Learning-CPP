# C++ Exercises – Nell Dale & Chip Weems (3rd Edition)

This repository contains my solutions to the **warm-up exercises (E)** and **programming problems (P)** from  
*Programming in C++ (3rd Edition)* by Nell Dale and Chip Weems.  

I started this project to strengthen my knowledge of **C++**, a versatile and high-performance language widely used in systems programming, competitive coding, and large-scale applications.

## 📂 Repository Structure
The repository is organized into two main directories:

├── E/ # Warm-up Exercises  
│ ├── 1/ # Chapter 1 exercises  
│ │ ├── E1.1.cpp # Solution source file  
│ │ ├── E1.1 # Executable  
│ │ └── data.txt # (optional) Input/output file  
│ ├── 2/  
│ └── ...  
│  
├── P/ # Programming Problems  
│ ├── 1/ # Chapter 1 problems  
│ ├── 2/  
│ └── ...  
│  
└── README.md  


- `E/` → Warm-up exercises (organized by chapter)  
- `P/` → Programming problems (organized by chapter)  
- Each numbered folder corresponds to a chapter.  
- Some problems include `.txt` files for input/output.  
- Executables (`a.out`, `ex1`, etc.) are created locally after compiling and may or may not be committed.

---

## ⚙️ Compilation & Execution
There is **no global Makefile**. Each solution can be compiled individually using your C++ compiler.

Example for an exercise:
```bash
cd E/1
g++ ex1.cpp -o ex1
./ex1
```

Example for a problem:
```bash
cd P/2
g++ problem2.cpp -o problem2
./problem2
```

## 🛠️ Requirements
Before running the programs, make sure you have:
- A **C++17 or later** compatible compiler (`g++` or `clang++`) installed
- A terminal or command prompt to compile and run the code

## 📘 Notes
- All solutions are written by me while practicing from the textbook.  
- Some problems include `.txt` files which are used for reading input or writing output.  
- This repository is intended as a **learning resource**. It does not contain official solutions.

---

## 🚀 Future Plans
- Add solutions for more chapters  
- Refactor code for better readability and consistency  
- Explore adding test cases for selected problems
